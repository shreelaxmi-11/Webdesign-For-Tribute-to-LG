<p>LG makes the task of comparing its phones relatively straightforward by dividing them up based on their price and capabilities.
   Handsets in the G series such as the LG G7 ThinQ are the flagship models designed to compete with the Apple iPhones and Samsung Galaxy Ss of the mobile world,
   V series handsets like the LG V30+ are aimed at photography aficionados and pack high-quality cameras; and K series handsets attempt to strike a balance between 
   price and performance that doesn't look or feel cheap.

   Unfortunately, even with this handy categorisation, pinning down which handset best meets your needs isn't always easy. Modern 
   smartphones tout more fancy features than a snake-oil salesman, and determining which ones are actually worthwhile can take a 
   lot of time and research. </p>
